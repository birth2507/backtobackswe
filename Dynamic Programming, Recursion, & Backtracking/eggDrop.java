  This is what the dynamic programming table looks like for 27 floors
  and 6 eggs.

  Each cell is the MINIMUM...WORST...amount of drops that we will need
  to guarantee that we can find the pivotal floor where eggs begin to
  break given 'row' eggs and 'col' floors.

  Eggs are on the left 'rows'. Floors are on the top 'cols'.

  Other Solutions: (that you'd probably not get to in a 45 minute interview)

  1.) Dynamic Programming with Binary Search
  Time Complexity: O( totalEggs * ( totalFloors * log( totalFloors ) ) )

  2.) Dynamic Programming with Optimality Criterion...whatever that is
  Time Complexity: O( totalEggs * totalFloors )
bhai bhut badhiya
  3.) The Mathematical Approach...k
  Time Complexity: O( totalEggs * log( totalFloors ) )

  I'd probably explain these wrong. I think...
